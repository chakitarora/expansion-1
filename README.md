# EXPANSION

Welcome to the EXPANSION Complementary Repository!

Explore the functional implications of protein-coding alternative splice variants with [EXPANSION](https://expansion.bioinfolab.sns.it/), an integrated web-server designed to unravel the impact of alternative splicing in cancer genomics. This repository houses the data, scripts, and resources supporting the research paper. Combined with DE protein-coding transcripts, domain analysis, protein interactions, and gene enrichment, EXPANSION offers an intuitive glimpse into the effects of splice variants. Dive into Ensembl transcripts, Interpro domains, PTMs, and more, to uncover functionally significant splicing events. Analyze pre-calculated or custom DE transcript datasets effortlessly, accelerating your journey to gain insights into protein spliceforms.
