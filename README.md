# EXPANSION
EXploring Protein AlterNative SplIcing cONsequence 

EXPANSION is a new pipeline and webserver to explore the functional consequences of an input list of protein-coding alternative splice variants, for example differentially expressed (DE) instances from transcriptomics datasets. We combined information of DE protein-coding transcripts from cancer genomics with information of domain architecture, protein interaction network and gene enrichment analysis.
